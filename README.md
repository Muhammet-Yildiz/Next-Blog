## <a name="features">✨ Features</a>

👉 **Authentication (Google / GitHub / Google One Tap)  🔐** <br/>

Authentication is handled using NextAuth, allowing users to sign in quickly via Google or GitHub. Additionally, with Google One Tap, users can log in even faster, without needing to manually enter credentials, offering a seamless and efficient authentication experience.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Login & Registration (Standard Authentication & Password Recovery) 🔑** <br/>

In addition to social logins, the application provides a Login and Register page for users who prefer to create accounts with an email and password. After registering, users can sign in using their credentials through the Login page. If a user forgets their password, they can easily reset it via the Forgot Password page, which sends a password reset link to their email. By clicking the link, users are redirected to the Reset Password page, where they can securely set a new password and regain access to their account.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Scroll Mode (Pagination / Infinite Scrolling)  🔄** <br/>

The application offers two different ways to display posts: Pagination and Infinite Scrolling. With Pagination, users can navigate through posts in discrete pages, allowing them to easily track their position. Infinite Scrolling provides a seamless browsing experience by automatically loading new content as the user reaches the bottom of the page. This flexibility enhances the post viewing experience, allowing users to choose their preferred method and enabling smooth navigation through large datasets.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Post Sorting (Sort By)  🔃** <br/>

The application includes a Post Sorting feature, allowing users to organize posts based on different criteria. Users can sort posts by the latest, most popular, or other custom metrics, enhancing the browsing experience by helping them find the content most relevant to their interests.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Post View Options (Grid / List)  🖼️** <br/>

Users can switch between two display formats: Grid, which shows posts in a compact, tile-based layout, and List, which provides a more detailed, vertical arrangement. This flexibility allows users to view content in their preferred style.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Efficient Search (Posts / Users / Topics) 🔍** <br/>

The application features a Search Modal that allows users to quickly find content by entering posts, users, or topics. This search function is optimized for performance, delivering fast and accurate results to enhance the overall browsing experience.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Post Detail (Views / Applause / Comments / Suggested Posts) 📝** <br/>

The Post Detail page showcases the full content of user-generated posts, including the number of views to track engagement. Users can interact with the post using the Applause button, triggering an animated effect to show appreciation. At the bottom of the page, Suggested Posts are displayed, helping users discover similar content and continue their reading journey seamlessly.

In addition, users can leave feedback or participate in discussions through a side-opening Comments Drawer, allowing for easy interaction without navigating away from the post. This feature encourages a more dynamic and engaging conversation around the content.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Write / Edit  Post (Editor & AI-Assisted Writing) 📝** <br/>

In the Write and Edit Post page, users can efficiently compose their posts using the rich features of React-Editor-JS. With a variety of available packages, the editor offers a flexible writing experience. Users are required to select at least one topic for their post, which can be done using the Add Tags Popover element.

Additionally, the integration of the Gemini AI-Integrated Chat Bot provides users with instant assistance. If they forget information or need help while writing, they can easily access the chatbot via a sidebar section and get answers in real-time, enhancing their overall writing experience.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Dark/Light Mode (Smooth Transitions with Next-Themes and Tailwind CSS) 🌞🌙** <br/>

The application offers a seamless Dark and Light mode toggle, providing users with the flexibility to choose their preferred theme. This feature is powered by the next-themes package, enabling efficient theme switching without page reloads. Coupled with Tailwind CSS, the transition between Dark and Light modes is smooth and visually appealing, enhancing the user experience with elegant color shifts and fast responsiveness.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **About Page (Posts & Follows Overview) 👤** <br/>

On the About page, you can view all the posts published by the user as well as see who they are following and who is following them. This page also provides an overview of the user's profile, allowing others to get to know more about their interests and activities on the platform.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **User Follow System (Stay Updated with Followed Users) 👥** <br/>

The application includes a powerful User Follow feature, allowing users to follow each other and stay connected. By following other users, you can easily track their posts and activities within the app. Although not detailed here, followers receive notifications based on the interactions and updates of the users they follow, helping them stay engaged with the latest content.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Notifications (Followed User Activity) 🔔📢** <br/>

Users receive notifications based on the activities of people they follow. For example, when a followed user follows someone new, Applauds a post, or Creates a new post, notifications are sent, keeping the user informed of interactions and new content from their followed accounts.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Saved Posts (Bookmark & Access Later) 📌** <br/>

Users have the option to save posts they find interesting or want to read later by simply clicking the Save button. These saved posts are automatically added to the Saved Posts List, where users can easily access them at any time. This feature ensures that users never miss out on content they intend to revisit.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Account Management (Profile Picture, Personal Information, Password, and Account Deletion) ⚙️** <br/>

The Account Management page allows users to fully manage their profiles. Here, users can easily update their profile pictures and edit personal information, ensuring their account details are always up to date. The page also provides the option to change your password for enhanced security, or even delete your account, which permanently removes all data associated with the user from the system.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Middleware Protection (Session-Based Access Control) 🚧** <br/>

To ensure security and privacy, the application implements Middleware that restricts access to certain pages based on the user's session status. If users attempt to access restricted content without a valid session, they are redirected to the login page. This ensures that only authenticated users can view sensitive information or interact with specific features, enhancing both security and user experience.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Responsive Website Design (Seamless Across Devices) 📱** <br/>

The project is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience across all devices, from mobile to desktop. This responsiveness is achieved effortlessly using Tailwind CSS, which simplifies the creation of fluid layouts and adaptive components. With minimal effort, the design scales beautifully across different screen sizes.
<br/>
<br/>

👉 **Metadata Optimization and SEO (Enhanced Performance & Visibility) 📈** <br/>

This project leverages Next.js’s built-in performance features to ensure fast page loads and efficient rendering. In addition to this, metadata optimization is a key focus, with dynamic metadata generated for each page. This approach enhances SEO, improving the website’s visibility in search engines and providing users with a more engaging experience through well-structured content and searchability.
